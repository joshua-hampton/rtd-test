Welcome to Dinosaurs's documentation!
=====================================

**Dinosours** is not really here, but we could imagine it to be a Python library all about dinosaurs. If you really want to learn about dinosaurs, go to `this website <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur>`_.

Check out the :doc:`usage <dinosaurusage>` section for futher pointless information, including a lot of rubbish on how to :ref:`install the project <installation>`.

.. note:
   This project does not exist. Don't expect anything useful.
